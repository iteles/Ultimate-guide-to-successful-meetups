#The Ultimate Guide to Organizing a Meetup [Work in Progress]
Currently just some initial thoughts for this post - will need to be completely reorganised into headings that make sense!

##Qualifiers
+ Experience comes from LadiesWhoCode
+ Tech meetups in the London area

##Where to Start
+ Research what already exists
  + If there's a 'defunct' meetup consider taking it over
- [ ] Find your niche - is there enough mileage there? Can you book speakers/have topics for various events?
- [ ] Find people to do it with you

####Alternative to a full blown meetup: Do something quick and simple
- Get a few people together for coffee and a conversation

##Finding venues
+ Even if you're not in the tech industry, there will most likely be technology companies that will cater to a similar audience to you - they're always a good place to start as they will be used to the meetup culture in tech. An example: if you're a crafting meetup, start with [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/about/) and their partners

To check:
+ Security at the venue (//TODO give examples)
+ Projector/presentation requirements (incl resolution if required)
+ Will the venue sponsor drinks
+ Will they sponsor food?
+ What time they expect the event to end
+ Whether they can provide wifi

##Finding speakers
- [ ] Checklist of what info needs to be included in a first approach to the speaker

##The meetup itself
- [ ] Planning (+ timings)
- [ ] Content
- [ ] On the day (incl security concerns at some venues)
  + Have adapters on hand as not everyone has HDMI ports on their laptops (//TODO Add most common adapters)
  + Empty USB sticks as a backup to put the presenter's deck on your own laptop
  + Stickers! (essential for tech meetups)
  + Display your twitter hashtag so people know what to use
  + Ensure wifi information is displayed
 
##Building your community
- [ ] Other events
- [ ] Twitter and facebook
- [ ] Blog posts and sharing useful information
- [ ] Speak to other meetup organizers!

##Sustainability
- [ ] Have a code of conduct
- [ ] Sponshorships?
